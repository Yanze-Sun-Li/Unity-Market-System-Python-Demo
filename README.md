**Unity Market System â€“ Open Source Project**

This project is a demo of a market simulation system that can be integrated directly into any Unity-based game. While the current GUI is quite simple and basic, this is only the beginning. The primary aim of the project is to develop a robust and interactive market simulator, where players can explore a game world filled with various markets, travel between them, gather data, predict prices, and even manipulate the economy to become wealthy.

The final goal is to create an immersive and dynamic market environment within a game world. Players will have the chance to strategize, gather intelligence, and forecast future trends to gain a competitive edge. The system will also be modular and flexible, allowing developers to integrate it into their games seamlessly.

**Features:**
- A fully functional fixed-price market demo where players can buy and sell items.
- Basic GUI elements for interacting with market data, though the interface is still in its early stages.
- Real-time price fluctuations, influenced by supply and demand within the simulation.
- The potential for future enhancements, such as traveling between markets, data collection for price prediction, and more advanced gameplay elements.

**The Vision for the Future:**
This project will expand into a full-scale market simulation game, allowing players to explore and interact with multiple markets across a game world. The final vision includes features like:
- **Market Exploration**: Travel between different markets within the game world, each with its unique characteristics and challenges.
- **Price Manipulation**: Influence the market prices to outmaneuver competitors and amass wealth.
- **Dynamic Economies**: React to and predict shifts in the game economy based on collected information.
